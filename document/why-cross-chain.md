# Why Cross-Chain ?

* The increasing number of L2s and chains will lead to a fragmentation of users, data, and liquidity, and the importance of asset bridging will keep increasing.
* Every blockchain product will move towards being able to support cross-chain use cases.
* The cross-chain NFT market is currently untapped, with the potential to cross-pollinate multiple communities in every domain
* cross-chain NFTs are not yet common, but there is high potential for them.
  * _Cross-chain NFT collections._
  * _Cross-chain NFT marketplaces._
  * Cross-chain NFT games
  * _Cross-chain lending using NFTs as collateral._
  * Cross-chain NFT governance

Cross-chain NFTs can find new use cases in NFTs that did not exist before
