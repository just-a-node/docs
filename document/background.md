# Background

&#x20;We challenged the Cross-chain NFT implementation using Connext at the ETHAmsterdam hackathon, and have been able to continue development and release the product since then. Previously, we had developed a multi-chain EVM NFT minting platform "Chocomint". There are synergies between Chocomint and NFTHashi as well, and when the two combine well, it enables the users to create NFTs more flexibly unbounded by chains.
